      "In a far away kingdom  there was a river  This river was home to many golden swans  The swans spent most of their time on the banks of the river  Every six months  the swans would leave a golden feather as a fee for using the lake  The soldiers of the kingdom would collect the feathers and deposit them in the royal treasury   One day  a homeless bird saw the river   The water in this river seems so cool and soothing  I will make my home here   thought the bird   As soon as the bird settled down near the river  the golden swans noticed her  They came shouting   This river belongs to us  We pay a golden feather to the King to use this river  You can not live here     I am homeless  brothers  I too will pay the rent  Please give me shelter   the bird pleaded   How will you pay the rent? You do not have golden feathers   said the swans laughing  They further added   Stop dreaming and leave once   The humble bird pleaded many times  But the arrogant swans drove the bird away    I will teach them a lesson!  decided the humiliated bird   She went to the King and said   O King! The swans in your river are impolite and unkind  I begged for shelter but they said that they had purchased the river with golden feathers    The King was angry with the arrogant swans for having insulted the homeless bird  He ordered his soldiers to bring the arrogant swans to his court  In no time  all the golden swans were brought to the King’s court    Do you think the royal treasury depends upon your golden feathers? You can not decide who lives by the river  Leave the river at once or you all will be beheaded!  shouted the King   The swans shivered with fear on hearing the King  They flew away never to return  The bird built her home near the river and lived there happily forever  The bird gave shelter to all other birds in the river  \n"
